# State Management System

This is the first iteration of a custom made state management system.
This system's purpose is to mimick other existing state management libraries with the purpose of both learning and improving my personal understanding and skills, and showing others that they don't necessarily need to use a full-fledged library for any project that requires synchronized GUI components.
